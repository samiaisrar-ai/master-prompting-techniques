## 📖 Basic Prompting Techniques
1. **Be Clear and Specific**  
   - Always clearly describe what you want the AI to do.  
   - Example: “Write a 100-word summary of this article” instead of “Summarize this.”

2. **Give Context**  
   - Provide context so the AI understands the scenario.  
   - Example: “Act as a social media manager and suggest 5 post ideas for Instagram.”

3. **Use Step-by-Step Instructions**  
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     Step 1: List the key points of the article.
     Step 2: Rewrite each point in simple language.
     Step 3: Provide a summary at the end.
     ```

4. **Set Output Style**  
   - Specify tone, style, or format.  
   - Example: “Write this in a friendly and casual tone for teenagers.”

5. **Test and Iterate**  
   - Always refine your prompt to get better results.

## 💡 Prompt Analogy
Think of a **prompt like giving directions to a taxi driver**:  

- **Vague prompt:** “Take me somewhere nice.” → AI might get confused.  
- **Clear prompt:** “Take me to the nearest Italian restaurant that is open now and has vegetarian options.” → AI understands exactly what you want.  

The clearer and more detailed your prompt, the better the AI’s response.
