You are an experienced digital marketer with 10 years of experience.
Provide a content strategy for a new e-commerce brand targeting Gen Z.

**Why:** AI responds in a tone and style aligned with the role, producing professional outputs.

---

### 3. **Conditional / Branching Prompts**
Use if-then logic to create dynamic outputs.  
**Example:**  

If the user is a beginner, provide a step-by-step explanation.
If the user is advanced, provide a concise summary with expert tips.

**Why:** Makes AI adaptive to different audience needs.

---

### 4. **Contextual / Memory Prompts**
Maintain context over multiple instructions or messages.  
**Example:**  

Remember that the target audience is small e-commerce business owners.
All suggestions should consider budget constraints and scalability.

**Why:** Ensures AI maintains consistency across outputs and sessions.

### 5. **Prompt Optimization**
Techniques to make prompts **shorter, clearer, and token-efficient**.  
- Use clear instructions and limit ambiguity.  
- Avoid unnecessary filler words.  
- Combine instructions logically.  
**Example:**  

Original: Can you please write a brief article that talks about the benefits of social media marketing in a way that is easy to understand for someone new to it?
Optimized: Write a simple 150-word article explaining social media marketing benefits for beginners.


---

### 6. **Automated Workflows**
Leverage AI for **repeatable tasks or chained operations**.  
**Example:**  


Analyze the dataset and identify top 5 trends.

Create a visualization plan for each trend.

Generate captions and social media content for each trend.

Export everything into a ready-to-post format.

**Why:** Enables AI to handle complex workflows without manual intervention.

---

### 7. **Advanced Output Control**
Control tone, style, format, and length precisely.  
**Example:**  

Write a persuasive product description in luxury tone, exactly 100 words, using bullet points for features and benefits.

**Why:** Guarantees output matches brand guidelines or professional standards.

---

### 8. **Error Prevention & Verification Prompts**
Make AI check its own outputs for accuracy.  
**Example:**  

After generating the list of marketing strategies, verify each strategy for feasibility and flag any unrealistic suggestions.

**Why:** Reduces mistakes and ensures reliability of results.
